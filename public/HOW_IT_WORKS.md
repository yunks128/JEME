# JPL's Earth Modeling Enterprise (JEME) Dashboard - How It Works

## Summary

The JPL's Earth Modeling Enterprise (JEME) Dashboard is a multi-component system for analyzing and visualizing scientific citation data across JPL Earth science models: RAPID, CARDAMOM, CMS-Flux, ECCO, ISSM, MOMO-CHEM, LES, and EDMF.

The system includes a React-based web dashboard for visualization, a multi-agent data verification pipeline, a keyword-based domain classifier with model-specific taxonomies, and a three-phase uncertainty quantification pipeline using a large language model (LLM).

### What the numbers mean

Every count on the dashboard is a **citation**, not a publication by the JPL team. Each model starts from a set of **team papers**: the peer-reviewed publications the modeling team wrote to describe the model itself. The pipeline then collects every peer-reviewed paper that cites one of those team papers, and each of those citing papers is classified by how deeply it engages with the model:

- **L1: Citation only** cites a team paper as background, with no direct use of the model or its outputs.
- **L2: Data Usage** uses model outputs or datasets.
- **L3: Model Adaptation** uses, modifies, extends, or couples the model or its methodology.

So a model showing 1,203 means 1,203 papers cite that model's team papers, not 1,203 papers written by the team.

The count is not purely external. Because the corpus is "everything that cites a team paper," it also picks up the team's **own later papers citing their earlier ones**: across the eight models this runs 2-5% of the total. For example, RAPID's team paper list holds 42 papers, 37 of which also appear among its 1,203 citations; ECCO's holds 2,038 papers, 697 of which appear among its 16,320 citations. Each model dashboard reports its exact figure. Team papers that cite no other team paper never enter the corpus at all. The team paper list itself is shown separately, above the charts.

## Data Collection

Citation data is collected from **Semantic Scholar** using the **team papers** for each model. A team paper is a foundational publication that defines, describes, or formally introduces a modeling system. The Semantic Scholar API returns all papers that cite each team paper, and those citing papers form the citation corpus that this dashboard counts and charts.

### Team Papers

Team papers typically include:
1. **Model Development & Description**: Papers presenting the design, formulation, or technical basis of the system.
2. **Core Applications**: Studies that demonstrate the model's capability and serve as reference examples.
3. **Reference Works**: Papers that the broader community consistently cites when applying, validating, or extending the system.

These team papers form the core bibliography for each model and are prominently featured in the dashboard. They are also the one input each modeling team controls directly: the accuracy of everything downstream depends on the team paper list being correct and complete.

## Multi-Agent Data Verification

A multi-agent pipeline cross-validates citation entries to ensure data quality:

1. **Team Paper Categorizer**: Classifies each team paper by relevance tier (Core > Infrastructure > Data/Methods > Domain Science > Tangential/Unrelated) using hierarchical keyword matching against the team paper title.
2. **Crossref Agent**: Resolves DOIs to validate existence and retrieve journal/venue metadata.
3. **Semantic Scholar Agent**: Batch API for title recovery (broken metadata) and venue enrichment for DOI-less entries.
4. **Keyword Classifier**: Scores citing paper relevance via domain-specific keyword matching on title + abstract.
5. **Deduplication Agent**: DOI-first, title-fallback duplicate detection.

### Verification Outcomes
- **ECCO**: Removed ~3,900 entries (off-topic geodesy, island biogeography, PFAS chemistry); enriched 7,600+ venue fields.
- **ISSM**: Repaired 1,904 broken team paper titles (42 "Untitled"/truncated IDs resolved via Semantic Scholar).
- **All other models**: Verified clean (91-96% keyword relevance match).

### Data Cleaning

A supplementary cleaning script (`scripts/clean_citation_data.js`) removes spam and metadata noise from citation JSON files. Three filter categories:
1. "Review of:" spam entries (auto-generated nano-electronics papers)
2. Placeholder/corrupted entries ("Insight Review Articles", "Digital Commons", etc.)
3. Supplementary material/metadata (interactive comments, printer-friendly versions)

## Research Domain Classification

### Model-Specific Taxonomies

Each model has a tailored set of 7-11 research domain categories with domain-specific keyword dictionaries, replacing the original shared 11-category generic taxonomy. This produces far more meaningful classification. For example, ECCO papers are classified into "Ocean Circulation & Transport", "Sea Level Change & Variability", and "Mesoscale & Submesoscale Dynamics" rather than a single "Ocean & Marine Science" bucket.

### Engagement Level Classification

Each citation is also classified by how deeply it engages with the cited model:

- **L1: Citation only**: The team paper is mentioned only as background or context, without using the model's data, methods, or results.
- **L2: Data Usage**: The model's outputs, datasets, or methods are applied as-is, without modification.
- **L3: Model Adaptation**: The model or its methodology is run, modified, extended, or coupled for new purposes.

Missions use a parallel three-tier vocabulary (Citation only / Data Usage / Review Paper) because "model adaptation" does not apply to an observing system.

## Uncertainty Quantification

The dashboard includes a three-phase uncertainty quantification pipeline that measures confidence in each citation's automated classification.

### Phase 1: Deterministic Scoring

Every citation entry receives an uncertainty score computed purely from metadata signals, with no LLM API calls required.

- **Evidence Confidence** (0-1): Weighted sum of data completeness signals: has abstract (35%), has DOI (15%), has venue (15%), has full authors (10%), and domain keyword match score (25%).
- **Pipeline Variance** (0-1): Measures disagreement between the keyword-based classifier and the LLM labels. Domain mismatch adds 0.5, engagement level mismatch adds 0.5.
- **Reasoning Confidence**: Heuristic proxy, 0.85 when an abstract is available, 0.5 without (title-only classification is less reliable).
- **Composite Confidence**: `0.45 * evidence + 0.45 * reasoning - 0.10 * pipeline_variance`, clamped to [5%, 99%].
- **Miscalibration Risk**: Flags entries at risk of systematic error (no abstract + high pipeline variance = "high" risk).

### Phase 2: Multi-Temperature LLM Sampling

For each entry, the system calls the LLM three times at different temperatures (0.1, 0.5, 1.0) and asks it to classify the engagement level, research domain (using the model-specific taxonomy), and self-assess its confidence.

- **Stochastic Variance** (0.0-0.67): Fraction of runs that disagree with the majority label. 0.0 means all three runs agree (high reliability), 0.67 means all three gave different answers (low reliability).
- **Reasoning Confidence**: Average of the LLM's self-assessed confidence across runs, normalized from a 1-5 scale to 0-1.
- **Updated Composite**: When Phase 2 data is available, the formula shifts to reward agreement: `0.35 * evidence + 0.35 * reasoning + 0.20 * (1 - stochastic_variance) - 0.10 * pipeline_variance`.

### Phase 3: Skeptic Agent

A final adversarial review targets the highest-risk entries, typically 10-20% of the total, where classifications are least certain:

- Entries with high miscalibration risk
- Entries with stochastic variance above 0.3
- Entries classified at high engagement (L3) but with composite confidence below 0.5

For each flagged entry, a skeptic prompt asks the LLM to *challenge* the existing classification and rate its agreement (1-5). If the skeptic strongly disagrees (agreement <= 2/5), an override flag is set, alerting reviewers that the entry's classification may need manual correction.

        I -->|No| L[Final Score]
        K --> L
    end
```

### Uncertainty Dashboard

Each model's uncertainty analysis is available at `/{modelName}/uncertainty`. The page displays:
- Composite confidence distribution and averages
- Evidence vs reasoning confidence matrix
- Confidence breakdown by engagement level and research domain
- Evidence gaps analysis
- Stochastic variance distribution (when Phase 2 data is available)
- Skeptic review summary and override-flagged entries (when Phase 3 data is available)

## Network Analysis

The main dashboard includes a cross-model connectivity analysis that identifies relationships between models through shared citations:

- **Bridge Citations**: Citations that cite team papers from more than one model, revealing cross-disciplinary connections.
- **Connection Matrix**: Pairwise connectivity between all models based on shared papers.
- **Cross-Model Authors**: Researchers who contribute to multiple model communities.
- **Domain Overlap**: Shared research domains across models.

### Data Flow

Each model's data is stored as a JSON file (`public/data/{MODEL_NAME}_analyzed.json`) containing citation entries in a standardized format with fields including title, authors, year, DOI, abstract, venue, citation count, research domain, engagement level, and uncertainty scores.

The frontend loads these files dynamically and processes them client-side using utility functions in `dataUtils.js` that normalize differences between Crossref and Semantic Scholar data formats.
